#  MacOS app to control Spotify from a KORG nanoKONTROL2

I got fed up of trying to find volume controls on my screen and wanted some physical buttons and sliders. I bought a second hand KORG nanoKONTROL2 and wrote this application.

It's my first foray into writing code for MacOS, so I suspect there's things that don't follow best practice. It's a personal project not intended for distribution so it's very much written on a "good enough" basis.
